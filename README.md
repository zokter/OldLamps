# Old lamps

There are three lamps each one with its own durability. The lamps turn on one after another: `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> ...` and so on. Each time a lamp is turned on, its durability go down by one. 

You need to determine how many times a lamp is turned on before the algorithm tries to turn on a lamp with zero durability.
